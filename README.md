# image_brightening
A simple python script for increasing the brightness and contrast of an image
This code consists of three functions. One for retrieving a values for 
brightness and contrast from a trackbar function. Another for calculating brightness 
and contrast and the main function. This project uses the openCV library and the 
python programming language. When the code is run, it accepts one 
positional argument supplied by the "--image" argument. This is the file path of the image 
to be edited.
